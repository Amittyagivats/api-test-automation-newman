# REST API Automation Framework  
### Postman · Newman · GitHub Actions

A production-style **REST API automation framework** built using **Postman** and **Newman**, with **CI/CD execution via GitHub Actions**.  
This project demonstrates real-world API testing practices including CRUD validation, negative testing, schema/contract validation, performance checks, and secure secrets management.
